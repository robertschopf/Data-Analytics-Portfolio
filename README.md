#  🧨 Robert Schopf - Data-Analytics-Portfolio

👋 Hi, I'm Robert! I've transitioned from operations and sports management to data analysis because I believe data has the power to transform businesses. I leverage SQL, Python, Tableau, and Google Sheets to extract data-driven insights and create visualizations that improve business value and operating procedures. 

Whether working independently or in teams, I focus on impactful analyses and data storytelling that drive these positive changes. On this GitHub, you’ll find some of my data analysis projects. Let’s explore data together!
