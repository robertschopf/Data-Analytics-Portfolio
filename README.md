## üìä Portfolio Projects

### ü¶Ñ [**1. Unicorn Company: Data Exploration & Insights (SQL + Tableau + Google Sheets)**](https://github.com/robertschopf/unicorn_project)

**Goal:**  
To perform in-depth data exploration using SQL, conduct data cleaning and transformation using Google Sheets, build an executive-level dashboard with Tableau, and generate actionable business recommendations for Unicorn based on the insights gained.

**Description:**  
The project involved examining Unicorn Company's sales, profit and customer data using SQL queries and converting the findings into an actionable Tableau dashboard. My analysis focused primarily on the KPI's of sales and profit for each category and segment

**Part 1:** Data Exploration with SQL
* Leveraged SQL to analyze Unicorn's database, focusing on sales, revenue, profit, and customer behavior. 

* Cleaned and joined tables such as 'customers,' 'orders,' and 'order_details.' Performed aggregations and generated rankings to identify top-performing products, categories, regions, and customer segments, revealing key trends and relationships within the data.

**Part 2:** Analysis with Google Sheets
* Created calculated columns (e.g., price per unit, profit margin) and utilized pivot tables to analyze data by category, segment, and region. Employed conditional formatting to highlight key findings and trends

**Part 3:** Insights & Dashboard with Tableau
* Developed a Tableau dashboard to visualize key insights and trends, empowering data-driven business decision-making within the company.

**Skills:**
* **SQL:** Data querying, joins, DML/DQL operations, subqueries, aggregations
* **Data Manipulation:** Data cleaning, filtering, transformation, and validation
* **Data Visualization:** Tableau for dashboard creation, interactive visualizations, and exploration
* **Business Analysis:** Data analysis, trend identification, KPI analysis, and development of actionable business recommendations

**Technology:** 
PostgreSQL, Google-Sheets, Tableau

**Key Insights:**
* Identification of the regions, categories, segments and products with the highest sales and best performing
* Presentation of potential market opportunities and specialization options by markt categories
* Recommendation of bundling the marketing budget and pricing structure linked to the discount strategy

### üöó [**2. Car Data Analysis (Python)**](https://github.com/robertschopf/car_data_analysis)

**Goal:**  
Gain deep insights by cleaning, transforming and analyzing the vehicle dataset to uncover correlations between vehicle characteristics and market behavior.

**Description:**  
This project utilized Python to analyze a car dataset, focusing on data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis. The dataset included details such as car make, model, engine specifications, fuel type, and price. The goal was to identify key trends and relationships between vehicle characteristics and market factors.

**Key Tasks:**
* Cleaned the data by addressing missing values, ensuring data type consistency and standardizing text formats. Filtered the dataset to include only cars produced from 1995 onwards.
* Created new features, such as "Total MPG" and "Price per Horsepower," to gain deeper insights into vehicle performance and value
* EDA includes the calculation of descriptive statistics, group analyses and the creation of various diagrams to identify and visualize patterns, trends and relationships between market size, car prices, engine HP or consumption.

**Skills:**
* Loading, cleaning, and transforming data  (with Pandas & NumPy)
* Conducting descriptive statistics
* correlation analysis 
* generating informative visualizations (with Matplotlib & Seaborn)

**Technology:** 
Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Key Insights:**
* Higher engine power typically correlates with higher MSRP
* Larger vehicles typically have higher MSRPs than smaller vehicles
* Higher power leads to higher fuel economy
* Direct shift transmissions typically offer better fuel efficiency than other transmission types
* There is little correlation between MSRP and popularity
